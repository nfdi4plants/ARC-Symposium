# Hands-On Symposium on ARC Communication and Interoperability 2025

2nd Hands-On Symposium on ARC communication and interoperability
June 23th to 25th, 2025

The symposium is an on-site, in presence event held at the Villa-Denis near Kaiserslautern. It will be held over three days.

The main goal is to integrate ARC-related work of different groups across consortia. Between discussions, coding and other hands-on work, there will be various talks from metadata experts surrounding the ARC ecosystem and beyond.

## Contribution Guide

The main contribution content in this repository is the documentation of the discussion results. 

For this, create a folder with a succinct name for your project. In this folder, there MUST be a `README.md`. This README SHOULD contain:
- Motivation or Explanation of the Problem
- Proposed Solution with Discussion of constraints
- Technical Details on Implementation

Take a look at the [Data Mesh Governance Policy Template](https://www.datamesh-governance.com/policies/template.html). They also propose a solution on Automation ("How could I automatically control and enforce adoption of this solution?"), which might be an insightful thing to consider.

In addition to the README, the folder MAY contain additional payload like code snippets or prototyped examples.
