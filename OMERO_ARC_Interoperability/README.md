#### Introduction

In this project we explore the interoperability between OMERO and ARC via RO-Crate. The project involves parsing an RO-Crate file from of an ARC and adding the necessary metadata(key-value pairs) with contextual metadata into OMERO as omero key-value pairs.

### Methodology

We first start with generating ro-crate metdata file in the json-ld format. This is usually created automatically in DataPLANT DATAHUB at the Deploy -> Package Registory -> isa_arc_json. The generated file i.e. arc-ro-crate-metadataOld.json was parsed with python's json package and read in omero webclient as key-value pair metadata. As there have been some changes in the ro-crate specification, here: [isa-ro-crate-profile](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/isa-ro-crate-profile/tree/release) , a new json-ld file named *arc-ro-crate-metadataNew.json* was generated by running in DataHUB at Build -> Jobs -> Create ARC JSON -> refesh button and parsed in python.


### Results and Limitations

Parsing both old and new versions of the json-ld file *arc-to-ro-crate-metadataOld.json* & *arc-to-ro-crate-metdataNew.json* worked as expected and specific metadata for investigation was parsed and read into omero with the older json-ld file and this can be seen in the image file *OMERO_KV_pairs.png*. The parsing the contextual metadata and adding it as metadata namespaces in OMERO was also on of the goals which was not further explored as newer version of json-ld was available.
The newer version of json-ld *arc-to-ro-crate-metdataNew.json* was parsed to extract metadata. Besides few keys like *Term Source Name* and *Investigation Publication Status Term Source REF* it was parsed as expected. The contextual information about the metata still need to be extracted and represented in omero webclient as key-value pairs with namespaces.

### Future Work

Future works involves parsing the *arc-to-ro-crate-metdataNew.json* file, both key-value metdata and contextual information and adding them to omero webclient metadata. The intented goal is to be able to add this ARC RO-crate json-ld parsing mechanism & oemro upload mechanism as a ARC json-ld import feature to omero-rdf plugin of omero.
